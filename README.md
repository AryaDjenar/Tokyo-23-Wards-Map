# Tokyo 23 Special Wards Interactive Map

This project is an interactive map showcasing Tokyo’s unique structure of 23 special wards, each with its own distinct character, history, and charm. The goal is to educate visitors about the often-overlooked fact that Tokyo is not a single city but a collection of self-governed areas, inspire exploration of these wards, and serve as a creative design practice. The aesthetic is heavily inspired by the iconic UI of **Digimon World 3**, blending nostalgia with modern interactivity.

### How to Use

- **Hover over the map** to highlight a ward.
- **Click on a ward** to view key information, including history, attractions, and hidden spots.
- Enjoy the **background music** to enhance your exploration experience, or control it using the integrated audio player.

### Inspiration

This project was inspired by my fascination with Tokyo’s vibrant wards, their unique histories, and the misconceptions about Tokyo’s administrative structure. The design pays homage to the Digimon World 3 UI, reflecting my love for retro aesthetics and interactive media.
